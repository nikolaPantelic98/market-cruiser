## Info: What we have done so far

* The project is divided into two parts: market-cruiser-backend & market-cruiser-frontend.
* In the market-cruiser-backend we made User Management Module - a module that manages users.
* There are 5 roles: Admin, Salesperson, Editor, Assistant, Shipper.
* A user can be created (first name, last name, password, email, photo, role, enabled) and a role can be assigned to him.
* All CRUD operations are enabled.
* Pagination and Sorting are implemented.
* Table content of the users can be exported & downloaded in CSV, Excel and PDF.
* Spring Security is implemented.
* The login page has been created. User can now log in and log out.
* The user can change his data now (excluding email and roles).
* From now on, each user can access links only with permission, depending on the role.
* Custom Error pages added (403, 404 and 500)
